# css-integration

Here, the point was to use all the css effect learned in the past and to try new glowing effect found on the internet and modified.
I had to use some css fot the chart and some bootstrap for the card design.

Here is the exercice instructions : https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-verou-1-26/tree/master/1.The-Field/4.HTML-CSS/5.End-of-Field/1.Trial-Run

Here are thinks to my button page , made with glowing effect found on the internet and redesigned : https://adrienclesse.github.io/css-integration/


Here is the first interface, for which I used different icons and font-family than in the istruction but the responsivess work is a great success, even for mobile phone : https://adrienclesse.github.io/css-integration/interface1.html

Here is the sexond interface : only problem met was about using transformation, or justify content to invert my chart's forms : https://adrienclesse.github.io/css-integration/interface2.html


Pleas enjoy the result, was a great pleasure to program!
